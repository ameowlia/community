## Problem
It is near impossible for community members to know what is being worked on and
why changes are being made. This makes it difficult for anyone to join our
community.

## Solution
1. Use branch protection to prevent any direct committing to the `develop` or `main`
   branch of all repos.
1. All changes must be submitted as a PR with an explanation of why the change
   is being made.

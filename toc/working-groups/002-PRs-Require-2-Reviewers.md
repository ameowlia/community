# PRs Require a Reviewers

Date of Forum to be Discussed:
Author: Amelia Downs - @ameowlia

## Problem
We have more approvers now (a great problem to have)! Let's make sure we keep a transparent and high level
of code quality.

## Solution
1. Each PR requires 2 github reviews.
1. One of the reviews must be by a working group approver or tech lead.

## FAQ

**Can I reivew and approve my own PR?**

No. With github reviews you are not allowed to review your own PR. 

**How do I review a PR?**

Go to the PR. On the right hand side there is a "reviewers" section.
If you are an approver you should see a gear there.
Click on the gear and add yourself- or others -as a reviewer.

**But I don't see a gear and can't assign a reviewer!**
As approvers you should have the correct access to add a reviewer. If you don't please reach out in the #wg-app-runtime-platform channel in cloudfoundry slack.
